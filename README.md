# I18nViz

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jhilden/i18n_viz.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jhilden/i18n_viz)

Gem to visualize i18n strings within a rails/ruby project.

**Problem**:

It is ver difficult for non-developers (e.g. translators and product managers) working with i18n Rails apps to make the connection from a string within the app to the correct i18n key to edit the corresponding translation.  "I would like to tweak the wording of the subtitle on this page, what string do I need to edit?"

**Solution**:

My solution is to hack the i18n keys into the frontend, so that the keys can be displayed as nice overlay tooltips on top of their strings right within the app.

If you you use a translation management app, such as http://webtranslateit.com, you get the additional benefit of clickable links that point you right to the correct string to edit within the translation tool.

More features (like inline editing) are possible in the future.



## Requirements

i18n_viz.js currently depends on jQuery being already loaded in your app (Tested with jQuery 1.6.1, but should also work with other versions)

In a Rails 3.1+ application you should simply include `gem 'jquery-rails'` in your Gemfile and your asset pipeline manifest.


## Installation

##### 1. Install the gem

Add the `i18n_viz` to your Gemfile

    gem 'i18n_viz'

And run

    bundle install


##### 2. Include the assets

I18nVIz is build as a Rails::Engine, which allows it provide its assets directly to the Rails asset pipeline for requirement in the app.  Therefore, if you have a Rails 3.1+ app and are using the asset pipeline, you can just add these simple lines to your asset pipeline manifest files to include them in your app:

In `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

    // = require i18n_viz
    

In `app/assets/stylesheets/application.js`:

    /* = require i18n_viz.css */
    
Or if you are using SASS, something like:

    @import "i18n_viz"
    
    
If you are not using Rails 3.1+ and the asset pipeline you will need to compile the Coffeescript to Javascript and copy and include the assets in the right places.  If there is demand for it I might provide some more comfortable way of doing this.


#### 3. Create initializer (optional)

In order to provide some custom setting for the I18nViz gem, it might make sense to create and initializer.

E.g. `config/initializers/i18n_viz.rb`:

    # encoding: utf-8
    unless defined?(I18nViz).nil?
      # determine under which condition the gem should be active
      I18nViz.enabled = !Rails.env.production?
        
      # Link to display in the I18nViz tooltip
      # e.g. pointing to that particular string in your apps translation tool
      # the i18n key will be appended to that URL
      I18nViz.external_tool_url = "https://webtranslateit.com/en/projects/1234567/locales/en..de/strings?utf8=âœ“&s="
    end


# How it works

The gem works by overwriting the t() and translate() helpers in your rails app to add the key of the i18n string after the actual translated content:

    en:
      examples:
        my_string: "My internationalized string"
        foo: "bar"
        
    =%span= "#{t("examples.my_string")} : #{t("examples.foo")}" 
    
Will result in

    <span>My internationalized string--examples.my_string-- : bar--examples.foo--</span>
    
The i18n_viz Javascript then parses this and enriches it into:

    <span class="i18n-viz" data-i18nKeys="['examples.my_string', 'examples.foo']">My internationalized string : bar</span>
    
The so enriched elements then get nice little tooltips attached with the i18n keys and possibly links to where they can be found/changed.


## Gotchas & Limitations

#### Works only in the view layer

The keys will currently only work for strings that are translated in the view layer using the `translate()` and `t()` i18n view helpers.  If you translate a string the model layer using `I18n.translate` method directly (e.g. ActiveRecord validations) the keys are not displayed in the frontend.


#### Assigning I18n output to variables

If you should be assigning i18n output directly into variables (e.g. within inline javascript, JS data-attributes, or other variables), the whole `--key--` thing might actually break your application.

For example this usage of a data-attribute:

    de:
      date:
        js_format: "dd.mm.yyyy"
        

    %body{:"data-date-format" => t("date.js_format")}
    
Will result in this broken output:

    <body data-date-format="dd.mm.yyyy--date.js_format--">

In those cases you need to pass an additional parameter `:i18n_viz => false` to the translate method in order to not append the key.

Example:

    %body{:"data-date-format" => t("date.js_format", :i18n_viz => false)}
    
    -----
    
    <body data-date-format="dd.mm.yyyy">
